			AT-AT pilots, also known as AT-AT Drivers, were Imperial combat drivers specialized in operating the Imperial Army's AT-AT walkers. Working in groups of two, they operated the walker's driving and firing controls, and were, in certain cases, overseen by a commander who also occupied the walker's cockpit.

			Coastal defender stormtroopers—more commonly known as shoretroopers and also known as the coastal guard, with those stationed on the planet Scarif referred to as Scarif stormtroopers — were a specialized variant of the Galactic Empire's stormtroopers trained and equipped for combat in tropical environments. Organized into the Coastal Defense Division, shoretroopers operated effectively as sergeants, which allowed them to command small squads of regular stormtroopers. One of the notable aspects of coastal defender stormtroopers was that the position they served in was temporary and subject to change along with their rank. On a galactic scale, shoretroopers as a whole were scarce, as the conditions for necessitating their employment were few and far between, as few stations or garrisons were located on coastal/tropical planets.

			Death troopers, also known as death soldiers, were an elite variant of stormtroopers specializing in stealth, espionage and lethality that served the Galactic Empire. Operating under Imperial Intelligence as the death trooper division, they acted as a protective detail for significant Imperial officers and members of the Tarkin Initiative, as well as special-assignment commandos. They wore black suits of body armor and specialized helmets with vocal scramblers, micro-motion sensors, and heads-up displays with data on enemy and friendly positions on the battlefield. Death troopers were trained in unarmed combat, heavy weapons, demolitions, improvised weaponry, guerrilla warfare, and marksmanship. Experts at covering their tracks, death troopers left little to no evidence of their missions. Identifiable by their distinct black armor, death troopers struck fear in the heart of anyone who crossed the Empire.

			Purge Troopers, also known as Purge Stormtroopers, were a specialized variant of stormtroopers used by the Inquisitorius of the Galactic Empire as expendable death squads. These soldiers were assigned to hunt down any surviving Jedi, being activated after the Clone Wars and subsequent termination of the cloning operation on Kamino. The first Purge Troopers were actually the last generation of clone troopers produced from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's template. As with their precursors in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic, those early Purge Troopers were programmed to obey Order 66, making them hostile against all Jedi. They were eventually supplemented and replaced by non-clone human recruits drawn from the Stormtrooper Corps. They were few in number and kept out of the public eye, with most citizens unaware they even existed.

			Scout troopers, also known as biker scouts, were a specialized stormtrooper variant used by the Galactic Empire on a range of missions, which mostly involved reconnaissance. In particular, scout troopers often used the 74-Z speeder bike. They had lighter armor than standard troopers, much like their urban counterparts, patrol troopers, who used C-PH patrol speeder bikes to navigate dense urban environments.

		<p>
			Stormtroopers (STs)—also known as Imperial stormtroopers and colloquially referred to as "bucketheads"—were the elite shock troops of the Galactic Empire, and were part of the Stormtrooper Corps, an independent military branch operating under the Imperial Army. These elite, obedient and zealous soldiers wore armor consisting of white plastoid plates over a black body glove, and their standard weapon was the E-11 medium blaster rifle. In addition to the standard variant trooper, various specialized units such as scout troopers and snowtroopers comprised the ranks of the corps. Alongside Imperial-class Star Destroyers and TIE fighters, stormtroopers served as reminders of the absolute power of the Empire. In addition, stormtroopers would serve with the regular infantry to enforce oppressive rule over the galaxy.

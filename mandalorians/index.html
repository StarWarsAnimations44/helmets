		<p>
			Boba Fett was a human male crime lord and former bounty hunter whose career spanned decades, from the fall of the Galactic Republic to the end of the rule of the Galactic Empire. Originally code-named Alpha, he was an unaltered clone of the famed Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett who raised the boy as his son. Boba emulated his father and genetic donor by wearing a customized suit of Mandalorian armor. His personal starship was the Slave I, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that once belonged to Jango.

			Din Djarin, also known as the Mandalorian or simply Mando, was a human male Mandalorian warrior during the era of the New Republic. With his Mandalorian armor, IB-94 blaster pistol, Amban sniper rifle, and distinctive beskar helmet, Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmaticâ€”a stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others. He hailed from Aq Vetina and became orphaned during the end of the Galactic Republic, and was raised as a foundling by the Children of the Watch, an orthodox cult that had broken off from mainstream Mandalorian society.

			Pre Vizsla was a human male Mandalorian warrior who was a descendant of Tarre Vizsla and led a terrorist organization, known as Death Watch, during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Formerly the governor of Concordia, Vizsla longed to restore the warrior heritage of his homeworld, the planet Mandalore, by overthrowing Duchess Satine Kryze's pacifist regime. Drawing on the support of his Mandalorian commandos, Vizsla made his bid for power during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars but failed several times in his efforts to conquer Mandalore.

		Mandalorian super commandos, also known as the Mandalorian traditionalists, were Mandalorian warriors who served the rogue Sith Lord Maul and his criminal syndicate, the Shadow Collective, during the Clone Wars. Following the dissolution of Duchess Satine Kryze's pacifist government, Mand'alor Pre Vizsla was slain in single combat by his one-time ally Maul, who claimed his opponent's place as leader of the planet Mandalore and its people. This act would serve to split Vizsla's organization, Death Watch, between Bo-Katan Kryze's supporters and the Mandalorians who sided with Maul. As the Mandalorian homeworld fell into a state of civil war, Maul's super commandos modified their combat armor to reflect their allegiance to the Dathomirian.

			Bo-Katan Kryze was a Mandalorian human female princess born into House Kryze. Over her life, she became a lieutenant in the Death Watch terrorist group, the commanding officer of its Nite Owls subdivision, the leader of the Mandalore resistance, and even the Mand'alor who laid claim over all of her homeworld, the planet Mandalore. Her complicated history was tied to that of her sister, Satine, who ruled as the Duchess of Mandalore but advocated for pacifistic teachings, which brought the two siblings into conflict; Kryze believed that Mandalore should take pride in its martial history and thus immediately joined Death Watch, a splinter group of those who believed in Mandalore's warrior past and opposed the new pacifist government.

			Koska Reeves was a human female Mandalorian who was a member of the Nite Owls. Several years after the Great Purge, Reeves was on the moon of Trask, where she helped steal an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser alongside Lady Bo-Katan Kryze, Axe Woves, and Din Djarin. Later, she and Kryze joined Djarin once again on a mission to rescue Djarin's companion Grogu and claim the light cruiser he was on for Kryze's efforts to take back Mandalore as well as to reclaim the Darksaber from Moff Gideon.

		Mandalorian super commandos, also known as the Mandalorian traditionalists, were Mandalorian warriors who served the rogue Sith Lord Maul and his criminal syndicate, the Shadow Collective, during the Clone Wars. Following the dissolution of Duchess Satine Kryze's pacifist government, Mand'alor Pre Vizsla was slain in single combat by his one-time ally Maul, who claimed his opponent's place as leader of the planet Mandalore and its people. This act would serve to split Vizsla's organization, Death Watch, between Bo-Katan Kryze's supporters and the Mandalorians who sided with Maul. As the Mandalorian homeworld fell into a state of civil war, Maul's super commandos modified their combat armor to reflect their allegiance to the Dathomirian.

			Rook Kast was a human female Mandalorian warrior who led the Shadow Collective's super commandos during the Clone Wars. After Maul, leader of the Shadow Collective, was imprisoned by the Sith on Stygeon Prime, Kast and commando Gar Saxon freed Maul and brought him to a Shadow Collective base on Zanbar. They were tracked by the forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and, in the ensuing battle, forced to flee to Ord Mantell. From there, they repelled a Separatist attack. Kast and Maul captured the Droid Army General Grievous in orbit, while Maul's ground forces captured the Separatist leader, Count Dooku.

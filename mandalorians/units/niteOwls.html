		The Nite Owls were an elite, mostly female Mandalorian unit made up of warriors led by Bo-Katan Kryze. When Bo-Katan joined Death Watch, the Nite Owls sided with the group and with its leader, Pre Vizsla. After Maul killed Vizsla in battle and proclaimed himself the new leader of the Death Watch, the Nite Owls, like the rest of the Death Watch, split in two, with members siding with either Maul or Bo-Katan. Those who joined Bo-Katan became part of the Mandalore resistance and fought against Maul's Shadow Collective and his Mandalorian super commandos, and they even attempted to free Bo-Katan's sister, the former Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore, whom they had formerly opposed due to her pacifist idealism.

			Bo-Katan Kryze was a Mandalorian human female princess born into House Kryze. Over her life, she became a lieutenant in the Death Watch terrorist group, the commanding officer of its Nite Owls subdivision, the leader of the Mandalore resistance, and even the Mand'alor who laid claim over all of her homeworld, the planet Mandalore. Her complicated history was tied to that of her sister, Satine, who ruled as the Duchess of Mandalore but advocated for pacifistic teachings, which brought the two siblings into conflict; Kryze believed that Mandalore should take pride in its martial history and thus immediately joined Death Watch, a splinter group of those who believed in Mandalore's warrior past and opposed the new pacifist government.

			Koska Reeves was a human female Mandalorian who was a member of the Nite Owls. Several years after the Great Purge, Reeves was on the moon of Trask, where she helped steal an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser alongside Lady Bo-Katan Kryze, Axe Woves, and Din Djarin. Later, she and Kryze joined Djarin once again on a mission to rescue Djarin's companion Grogu and claim the light cruiser he was on for Kryze's efforts to take back Mandalore as well as to reclaim the Darksaber from Moff Gideon.

			Axe Woves was a human male Mandalorian from the planet Mandalore who served with the Mandalorian resistance during the New Republic's era. In 9 ABY, Woves was on the moon of Trask alongside resistance fighters Lady Bo-Katan Kryze and Koska Reeves, where they rescued another Mandalorian named Din Djarin from a group of Quarren. Djarin was initially put off by their removal of their helmets, but soon joined forces with Woves and his comrades after they rescued him a second time.

			Boba Fett was a human male crime lord and former bounty hunter whose career spanned decades, from the fall of the Galactic Republic to the end of the rule of the Galactic Empire. Originally code-named Alpha, he was an unaltered clone of the famed Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett who raised the boy as his son. Boba emulated his father and genetic donor by wearing a customized suit of Mandalorian armor. His personal starship was the Slave I, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that once belonged to Jango.

		<p>
			Din Djarin, also known as the Mandalorian or simply Mando, was a human male Mandalorian warrior during the era of the New Republic. With his Mandalorian armor, IB-94 blaster pistol, Amban sniper rifle, and distinctive beskar helmet, Djarin was both well-equipped and enigmatic—a stranger whose past was shrouded in mystery to others. He hailed from Aq Vetina and became orphaned during the end of the Galactic Republic, and was raised as a foundling by the Children of the Watch, an orthodox cult that had broken off from mainstream Mandalorian society.

Drawing on the support of his Mandalorian commandos, Vizsla made his bid for power during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars but failed several times in his efforts to conquer Mandalore.
